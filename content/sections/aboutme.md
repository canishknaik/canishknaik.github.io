In 2025-26, I will be a Postdoctoral Scholar at the [O'Donnell Center for Behavioral Economics](https://haas.berkeley.edu/behavioral-economics/) at UC Berkeley, before joining the [IIES](https://www.su.se/institute-for-international-economic-studies/) as an Assistant Professor in 2026.

My research examines how governments can optimally provide assistance and social protection to help the most vulnerable meet their basic needs, focusing on the role of psychological factorsâ€”such as mental health and behavioural biasesâ€”in shaping behaviour and policy effectiveness.

I have a BA in Mathematics from the University of Cambridge and a PhD in Economics from the LSE. Before my PhD, I worked as an Economist at [The Behaviouralist](https://thebehaviouralist.com/), a behavioural science research consultancy.
