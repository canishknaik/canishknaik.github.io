I am a Postdoctoral Scholar at the [O'Donnell Center for Behavioral Economics](https://haas.berkeley.edu/behavioral-economics/) at UC Berkeley. I will join the [IIES](https://www.su.se/institute-for-international-economic-studies/) as an Assistant Professor in 2026.

My research examines how governments can optimally provide assistance and social protection to help the most vulnerable meet their basic needs. I focus on the role of psychological factors, such as mental health and behavioural biases, in shaping behaviour and policy effectiveness.

I have a BA in Mathematics from the University of Cambridge and a PhD in Economics from the LSE. Before my PhD, I worked as an Economist at [The Behaviouralist](https://thebehaviouralist.com/), a behavioural science research consultancy.
