I am PhD student in the Economics Department at the [London School of Economics and Political Science](https://www.lse.ac.uk/economics)

Canishk completed his BA in Mathematics at the University of Cambridge and has an MSc in Applicable Mathematics from the LSE. Before the PhD, he was an Economist at The Behaviouralist, a behavioural science research consultancy. There, he worked on projects to estimate treatment effects of early childhood education interventions, as well as designed RCTs to study the effect of communications on the take-up of energy efficient home improvements.

Canishk's primary research goal is to find out how to design fair and inclusive social protection policies which maximise societal well-being. His main project looks to quantify the welfare consequences of the mentally ill being screened out of receiving social assistance due to administrative burden. He also works on a project characterising the socioeconomic determinants of mental health. Lastly, he is analysing the robustness of US & UK public housing allocation policies to applicant bias.
