I am PhD student in the Economics Department at the [London School of Economics and Political Science](https://www.lse.ac.uk/economics) with interests in public and behavioural economics. My LSE webpage is [here](https://www.lse.ac.uk/economics/people/research-students/canishk-naik), and my email is [c.naik@lse.ac.uk](mailto:c.naik@lse.ac.uk)

I have a BA in Mathematics from the University of Cambridge and an MSc in Applicable Mathematics from the LSE. Before the PhD, I was an Economist at The Behaviouralist, a behavioural science research consultancy. There, I worked on projects to estimate treatment effects of early childhood education interventions, as well as designed RCTs to study the effect of communications on the take-up of energy efficient home improvements.

My primary research goal is to find out how to design fair and inclusive social protection policies which maximise societal well-being. The main project I am working on looks to quantify the welfare consequences of the mentally ill being screened out of receiving social assistance due to administrative burden.
