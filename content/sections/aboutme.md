I am a PhD student in the Economics Department at the [London School of Economics and Political Science](https://www.lse.ac.uk/economics) with interests in public and behavioural economics. 

My LSE webpage is [here](https://www.lse.ac.uk/economics/people/research-students/canishk-naik), and my email is [c.naik@lse.ac.uk](mailto:c.naik@lse.ac.uk).

I have a BA in Mathematics from the University of Cambridge and an MSc in Applicable Mathematics from the LSE. Before the PhD, I was an Economist at [The Behaviouralist](https://thebehaviouralist.com/), a behavioural science research consultancy.

My primary research goal is to analyse how governments should optimally provide assistance and social protection to help the most vulnerable in society meet their basic needs. In my work, I focus on how psychological factors, including mental health and behavioural biases, affect how people interact with the policy environment and how we evaluate the welfare effects of public programs.
