    We consider the optimal policy problem of a benevolent planner, who is uncertain about an individual’s true preferences because of inconsistencies in revealed preferences across be- havioral frames. We adapt theories of expected utility maximization and ambiguity aver- sion to characterize the planner’s objective, which results in welfarist criteria similar to social welfare functions, with intrapersonal frames replacing interpersonal types. Under paternalistic risk aversion or ambiguity aversion, a policy is less desirable to the planner, holding all else fixed, when it leads to more disagreement about welfare from revealed pref- erences. We map some examples of behavioral models into our framework and describe how this notion of robustness plays out in applied settings.
