    This paper demonstrates that people with poor mental health are screened out of receiving social assistance, implying barriers-to-access are too high. I develop a theoretical framework showing that average take-up levels—along with take-up responses to changes in benefits and barriers—reveal whether the neediest individuals face the highest costs in overcoming barriers, indicating ineffective targeting. I empirically examine take-up behaviour using Dutch administrative data and quasi-experimental policy variation. Individuals suffering from mental disorders have an 80% higher cost of take-up barriers relative to those with good mental health, while they value benefits twice as much. The positive correlation between need and cost across mental health states indicates that current policy does not effectively reach people requiring assistance the most. These estimates imply reducing barriers to take-up would be twice as effective as increasing benefits.

    We consider the optimal policy problem of a benevolent planner, who is uncertain about an individual’s true preferences because of inconsistencies in revealed preferences across be- havioral frames. We adapt theories of expected utility maximization and ambiguity aver- sion to characterize the planner’s objective, which results in welfarist criteria similar to social welfare functions, with intrapersonal frames replacing interpersonal types. Under paternalistic risk aversion or ambiguity aversion, a policy is less desirable to the planner, holding all else fixed, when it leads to more disagreement about welfare from revealed pref- erences. We map some examples of behavioral models into our framework and describe how this notion of robustness plays out in applied settings.

    When allocating scarce resources such as public housing units to applicants in a waiting list, welfare depends on applicants’ preferences (match values and waiting costs) as well as their choices (which may involve errors). To trade off between allowing agents to wait for better matches and prioritizing agents with high waiting costs, allocation mechanisms impose restrictions on choices. Public housing allocation mechanisms in the UK restrict the set of available options that an applicant may accept, while mechanisms in the US restrict the number of times an applicant may reject. We examine how these different ways of restricting choices influence welfare, both theoretically and empirically. Using data on preferences for public housing in the US and the UK, we show how welfare compares under rationality and explore the sensitivity of the mechanisms to choice-error.
