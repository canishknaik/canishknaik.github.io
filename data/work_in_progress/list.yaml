    What drives the stark inequalities in mental health across socio-economic groups? Using administrative data from the population of the Netherlands, this paper uncovers a striking non-linear gradient in mental health by income: mental health sharply deteriorates below an income threshold near the poverty line but shows little association with income above this level. We find that the socio-economic gradients are strongest for working-age individuals, are not driven by access to health-care and are mostly explained by work status. Major adverse events such as physical health shocks and job losses contribute little to the overall gradient. Rather, the evidence suggests social drift as the primary mechanism: those with poor mental health sort into lower incomes over the lifecycle. These results highlight the economic vulnerability of people with poor mental health and the importance of a broad social safety net.

    Disaster recovery often focuses on rebuilding physical infrastructure, overlooking the mental health impact of  traumatic events like floods. In Pakistan, where flooding in 2022  submerged a third of the country under water and lasted up to 8 months, over one in five flood affectees report severe psychological distress 2 years later. When asked about the long-term consequences of flooding, worsened mental and physical health is the second most commonly reported impact, following housing damage (Jalal and Simpson, 2024). Ignoring mental health in reconstruction may prolong the socio-economic impact of disasters by limiting individuals' ability to work, plan, and recover. This project studies the interaction between physical and psychological recovery in flood-affected communities, by fielding a locally developed mental health literacy initiative, cross-randomised with a housing reconstruction program. This 2x2 design allows us to compare the benefits of mental health support against the standard infrastructure-focused approach, and explore complementarities. Our findings aim to measure the non-economic losses and damages of climate catastrophes, and inform more holistic disaster recovery policies that address both physical and psychological needs.
