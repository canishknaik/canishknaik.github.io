    What drives the stark inequalities in mental health across socio-economic groups? Using administrative data from the population of the Netherlands, this paper uncovers a striking non-linear gradient in mental health by income: mental health sharply deteriorates below an income threshold near the poverty line but shows little association with income above this level. We find that the socio-economic gradients are strongest for working-age individuals, are not driven by access to health-care and are mostly explained by work status. Major adverse events such as physical health shocks and job losses contribute little to the overall gradient. Rather, the evidence suggests social drift as the primary mechanism: those with poor mental health sort into lower incomes over the lifecycle. These results highlight the economic vulnerability of people with poor mental health and the importance of a broad social safety net.

    Disaster recovery often focuses on rebuilding physical infrastructure, overlooking the mental health impact of traumatic events like floods. In Pakistan, where flooding in 2022 submerged a third of the country and lasted up to 8 months, women exposed to a more intense flood shock were 11 pp more likely to have severe psychological distress 2 years later. Ignoring mental health in reconstruction may prolong the socio-economic impact of disasters by limiting individualsâ€™ ability to work, plan, and recover. This project explores complementarities between mental health support and the standard infrastructure-focused approach by randomizing a trauma-based mental health intervention and leveraging natural variation in access to a housing reconstruction program in a 2x2 design. Our findings aim to measure the non-economic losses and damages of climate catastrophes, and inform more holistic disaster recovery policies that address both physical and psychological needs.
