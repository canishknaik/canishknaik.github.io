    This paper documents and analyzes the relationship between socio-economic factors and key measures of mental health. We demonstrate a sharp deterioration of mental health below an income threshold around the poverty line, while the impact of income beyond the threshold level are remarkably flat. The persistence of low socio-economic status further increases the risk of poor mental health. We find that the socio-economic gradients are strongest for working-age individuals, are not driven by access to health care and mostly explained by work status. Big economic  events such as physical health shocks and job losses seem not to contribute much to the overall gradient. Rather, the evidence suggests social drift as the primary mechanism: those with poor mental health sort into lower incomes over the lifecycle.

    Disaster recovery often focuses on rebuilding physical infrastructure, overlooking the mental health impact of  traumatic events like floods. In Pakistan, more than one in five people report severe psychological distress 2 years after the devastating 2022 floods, and worsened mental and physical health is the second most commonly reported long-term impact after housing damage (Jalal and Simpson, 2024). Ignoring mental health in reconstruction could prolong the socio-economic impact of disasters by limiting individuals' ability to work, plan, and recover. This project studies the interaction between physical and psychological recovery in flood-affected communities, by piloting a locally developed mental health literacy initiative, cross-randomised with a housing reconstruction program. This 2x2 design allows us to compare the benefits of mental health support against the standard housing-focused approach and explore complementarities. Our findings aim to measure non-economic loss and damage of climate catastrophes and inform more holistic disaster recovery policies that address both physical and psychological needs.
