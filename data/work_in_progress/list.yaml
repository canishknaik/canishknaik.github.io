    This paper demonstrates that high-need individuals with mental illnesses are screened-out of receiving social assistance, implying barriers-to-access are too high. I develop a theoretical framework which shows we must look past average take-up rates in order to identify whether the neediest individuals also face the highest costs of overcoming barriers, which would indicate ineffective targeting. Additionally identifying take-up responses to changes in benefits and barriers is sufficient to evaluate welfare effects. I empirically estimate these responses using quasi-experimental policy variation and administrative data from the population of the Netherlands. I find people with poor mental health have an 80% higher cost of take-up barriers compared to those with good mental health. People with mental disorders also need benefits twice as much. These estimates imply reducing barriers to take-up would be a 2.3x more effective policy than increasing benefits.

    This paper documents and analyzes the relationship between socio-economic factors and key measures of mental health. We demonstrate a sharp deterioration of mental health below an income threshold around the poverty line, while the impact of income beyond the threshold level are remarkably flat. The persistence of low socio-economic status further increases the risk of poor mental health. We find that the socio-economic gradients are strongest for working-age individuals, are not driven by access to health care and mostly explained by work status. Big economic  events such as physical health shocks and job losses seem not to contribute much to the overall gradient. Rather, the evidence suggests social drift as the primary mechanism: those with poor mental health sort into lower incomes over the lifecycle.
