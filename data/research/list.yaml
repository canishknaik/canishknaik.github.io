      Mental disorders are disproportionately common among people receiving government benefits. However, evidence from psychology suggests administrative burdens associated with taking up assistance has a high incidence on people with poor mental health, which could lead them to be screened out. This would suggest even more selection absent ordeals. This paper studies self-targeting of social assistance recipients with respect to mental health. I find a negative selection w.r.t. moderately poor mental health, accounting for income and reverse causation effects, however no evidence that the seriously-ill take-up more than moderates. My theoretical framework suggests that selection is driven by need vs ordeal-incidence and highlights a way to disentangle these. I show how welfare implications can be derived by looking at targeting effects of policy. Finally, I look to characterise how selection develops as mental health responds to the take-up environment and see if there is evidence of a psychological poverty trap.

      When allocating scarce resources such as public housing units to applicants in a waiting list, welfare depends on applicantsâ€™ preferences (match values and waiting costs) as well as their choices (which may involve errors). To trade off between allowing agents to wait for better matches and prioritizing agents with high waiting costs, allocation mechanisms impose restrictions on choices. Public housing allocation mechanisms in the UK restrict the set of available options that an applicant may accept, while mechanisms in the US restrict the number of times an applicant may reject. We examine how these different ways of restricting choices influence welfare, both theoretically and empirically. Using data on preferences for public housing in the US and the UK, we show how welfare compares under rationality and explore the sensitivity of the mechanisms to choice-error.
