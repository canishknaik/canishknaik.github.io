Abstract
----- 

Mental disorders are disproportionately common among people receiving government benefits. However, evidence from psychology suggests administrative burdens associated with taking up assistance has a high incidence on people with poor mental health, which could lead them to be screened out. This would suggest even more selection absent ordeals. This paper studies self-targeting of social assistance recipients with respect to mental health. I find a negative selection w.r.t. moderately poor mental health, accounting for income and reverse causation effects, however no evidence that the seriously-ill take-up more than moderates. My theoretical framework suggests that selection is driven by need vs ordeal-incidence and highlights a way to disentangle these. I show how welfare implications can be derived by looking at targeting effects of policy. Finally, I look to characterise how selection develops as mental health responds to the take-up environment and see if there is evidence of a psychological poverty trap.
