title: "A Welfare Analysis of Public Housing Allocation Mechanisms"
collection: research
permalink: /research/pha_welfare
abstract: 'When allocating scarce resources such as public housing units to applicants in a waiting list, welfare depends on applicantsâ€™ preferences (match values and waiting costs) as well as their choices (which may involve errors). To trade off between allowing agents to wait for better matches and prioritizing agents with high waiting costs, allocation mechanisms impose restrictions on choices. Public housing allocation mechanisms in the UK restrict the set of available options that an applicant may accept, while mechanisms in the US restrict the number of times an applicant may reject. We examine how these different ways of restricting choices influence welfare, both theoretically and empirically. Using data on preferences for public housing in the US and the UK, we show how welfare compares under rationality and explore the sensitivity of the mechanisms to choice-error.'
