      <description>I am PhD student in the Economics Department at the London School of Economics and Political Science with interests in public and behavioural economics.&#xA;I have a BA in Mathematics from the University of Cambridge and an MSc in Applicable Mathematics from the LSE. Before the PhD, I was an Economist at The Behaviouralist, a behavioural science research consultancy. There, I worked on projects to estimate treatment effects of early childhood education interventions, as well as designed RCTs to study the effect of communications on the take-up of energy efficient home improvements.</description>
