      <description>I am a PhD student in the Economics Department at the London School of Economics and Political Science with interests in public economics and psychology &amp;amp; economics.&#xA;I have a BA in Mathematics from the University of Cambridge and an MSc in Applicable Mathematics from the LSE. Before the PhD, I was an Economist at The Behaviouralist, a behavioural science research consultancy.&#xA;My primary research goal is to analyse how governments should optimally provide assistance and social protection to help the most vulnerable in society meet their basic needs.</description>
